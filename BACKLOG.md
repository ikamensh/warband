# Warband backlog

Created 2026-09-16. This is the working queue for taking one task at a time.
The [Early Access criteria](docs/warband-early-access-criteria.md) remain the
release gates; [progress](docs/warband-early-access-progress.md) holds their
evidence. Shared engine work belongs in the [Saga2D backlog](../saga2d/BACKLOG.md).

Keep IDs stable and never reuse one. When starting an item, change its status
to `in progress` and record the branch; record its acceptance before
implementing and its evidence after, and split larger discoveries into new
IDs. `proposed` items still need scope selection. Within each priority, the
order is the suggested sequence, not a requirement to finish every earlier
item first. Once an item is done and merged into main, delete its row and
section; git history keeps the record. The last ID given is **WB-053**; a new
item takes the next one and updates this line.

Done and removed 2026-09-18, every one merged into main (whose code is live as
Warband 0.2.30): WB-001 to WB-009, WB-015, WB-017 to WB-023 and WB-025 to
WB-034. Their acceptance and evidence are in
[the backlog at `1a6e08b`](https://github.com/ikamensh/warband/blob/1a6e08b73872cb595756a9d4ba7bc96c685c5ef0/BACKLOG.md).

## WB-013 — Fresh-player and cross-platform acceptance

Refresh W06/W15 with the current candidate: observe first launch, first economy,
first battle, loss/resign, save/resume and the website-to-online-match journey.
Include a complete human match on the published Mac/Windows candidate and
record hardware, version and obstacles. Use `tools/visual_lint.py` for what it
can find, while retaining human assessment of animation and clarity.

**Done when:** each blocker becomes a reproducible ticket and is resolved or
explicitly deferred; current evidence replaces stale gate claims. Automated
checks cannot mark the human playtest complete.

**Blocked 2026-09-18:** this needs people who have not played before; nothing
to build until a playtest happens. What unblocks it: one or two fresh players'
sessions (a recording or notes on what confused them), on a Mac or on Windows.
The Windows report that came first is closed (WB-021, WB-022), and a Windows
desktop for scripted checks is [a runbook away](../saga-online/docs/windows-test-box.md).
